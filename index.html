            <p id="blurb">I'm an aspiring web developer with an affinity for coding. I'm originally from St. Louis, MO, and made my way out to Denver in 2015 after receiving a job offer.  I spent 8 years serving in the US Navy, 4 of which were out of Pearl Harbor, HI, and I completed 2 deployments during that time.  My hobbies include coding (obviously), road-biking, and sand volleyball. My education includes a high school diploma, and a Masters degree in International Relations from Webster University. </p>

            <p id="p2">My favorite all-time show is probably Battlestar Galactica, followed by either Star Trek: The Next Generation, or maybe Star Trek: Voyager. The military couldn't kill my inner-dork.</p>

            <p id="p3">One could consider pizza as my overall favorite food because that's what I eat more than anything, but I love steak and burgers too. Thai food is excellent as well, especially chicken drunken noodle and general chicken.  The biggest downfall with my diet though is the amount of soda I drink, which adds up to at least 3 or 4 glasses a day. I don't recommend it, unless you work out for at least an hour every day, which I don't.</p>
