            <p id="blurb">I’m an eight-year Navy veteran with cryptologic experience in “decoding” within a tactical environment, and am now on the flip-side of that by building programs in the private sector. 
 
                Programming excites me, and I’m a life-long dedicated student, regardless if I’m in an actual classroom or not.
                I’m looking forward to tackling challenges with a creative team and putting my skills to the test, and I believe both my military experience and Master’s degree are indicators of my commitment to hard-work and learning.

            <p id="p2">I have experience with front-end languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well as technologies such as Bootstrap, jQuery, JSON, Firebase, and Ajax.</p>

            <p id="p3">Aside from coding, my hobbies including exploring mountain trails, playing sand volleyball, and biking about 5 times a week. I'm no stranger to the outdoors, or just enjoying the simpler things in life.   </p>
