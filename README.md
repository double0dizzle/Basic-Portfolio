# Basic-Portfolio

This is my first attempt to build a personal portfolio.  It is meant to be viewed on a desktop only, as I didn't incorporate much code for mobile responsiveness. The portfolio consists of three documents that can be viewed by the user.  The "About" page is my opener and includes a pic and a statement.  The "Portfolio" page currently includes 7 past projects of mine from the coding bootcamp I attended at the University of Denver.  The "Contact" page has my info, along with a brief description of my first app on my portfolio page, "The Perfect Ride."
