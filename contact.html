                                <p>        Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoyed looking at my past projects as much as I took pleasure in making them.  Many of my projects tend to be nature themed, since I spend much of my time around parks and the outdoors. <br><br>
                                ThePerfectRide, a bike app which appears on my portfolio page, was done in collaboration with Bryan Yunis, Jordan Schechter, and Top Alt. This app was built for cyclists and outdoor-enthusiasts, and has a special WindWatch feature built into it.  When activated, the Windwatch button changes color according to the windspeed of the user's nearest weatherpoint, which the user is allowed to choose up to twelve per route.<br><br> 
                                The second function of this feature is that it creates an alarm on any weatherpoint that has a headwind of over 12mph, which may persuade the user to alter their route if multiple points have serious head-wind.  If the user feels like the route should be changed, then they can add markers at arbitrary points on the map, and then drag their route to cross those points.  When those markers are clicked on, weather data such as wind speed and wind direction will appear on the map.  
                                <br><br>If you have any questions or comments then please don't hesitate to contact me.  Have a wonderful day!    <br><br> -Mike Dickmann </p>
